### The Generalized Barycentric Coordinates Tool visualizes various barycentric coordinates for simple polygons in 3D.

The tool is developed by Bob van der Vuurst and supervised by Jiri Kosinka for the 'Short Programming Project' course at the University of Groningen (RUG). Jiri Kosinka is the head of the RUG's [Scientific Visualization and Computer Graphics (SVCG)](https://www.cs.rug.nl/svcg/) research group and is also an author of the paper the tool is based on [1].

## Documentation
For an overview of the provided functionalities and documentation, please check the project report, which can be found [here](documentation/GeneralizedBarycentricCoordinates.pdf).

## Deployments
The tool is deployed on Github Pages, which can be found [here](https://bob-vdv.github.io/BarycentricCoordinates/). 

The tool will also be deployed on the [web tools section of the SVCG website](https://svcg.web.rug.nl/).
